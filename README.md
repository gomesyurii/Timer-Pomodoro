This is a extremely simple project and user-friendly Pomodoro timer, built with pure JavaScript. The Pomodoro method is a time management technique that encourages people to work with time rather than against it.

## Features
- 25-minute countdown for focus sessions.
- 5-minute countdown for rest sessions.
- Desktop notifications when the time is up.
- Background color changes depending on whether you're in a focus or rest session.
- "Set state" button to stop the countdown and change the state (between focus and rest) before starting anew.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local computer.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Click the "Start" button to begin the countdown.
4. When the time is up, a notification will be displayed, and the countdown for the next session will start automatically.
5. Use the "Set state" button to stop the countdown and change the state before starting again.
